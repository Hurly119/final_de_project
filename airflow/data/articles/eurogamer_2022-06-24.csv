mario has, of course, been voiced by charles martinet since 1992, and his video game performance has become inseparable from nintendo's flagship character. as such, mario fans were somewhat aghast last year when mario creator shigeru miyamoto announced pratt would be replacing martinet as the voice of mario in the upcoming film.

it's a casting decision that few seemed to have warmed to even ten months on, despite the best efforts of chris meledandri, producer of the super mario film, who insisted pratt's performance as mario was ""phenomenal"" last november. meledandri then defended his star again this week, saying criticism of pratt's casting would ""evaporate"" when people heard his performance.

the blade runner game, for those unfamiliar, released in 1997, and, unlike the vast majority of licensed adaptations, was an extraordinary piece of work, not only managing to perfectly capture the neon-streaked dystopian atmosphere of the movie in a story that ran parallel to its action, but doing so in ways both wildly ambitious and legitimately groundbreaking.

although blade runner takes its cue from narrative-driven point-and-click games, it immediately distinguishes itself from its genre peers by sending players, in the role of blade runner ray mccoy, on a heavily randomised adventure. the goal remains the same each play-through, in that players must use their investigatory skills to identify and hunt down a number of replicants, but exactly which characters are replicants is determined at the start of a new game, subtly changing their behaviour as the story unfolds.

away from combat, shez spends their free time in a war camp, travelling between facilities on foot. there are no side tasks and fishing is tragically missing, but you'll otherwise find a faithful recreation of three houses' social mechanics that have been slightly trimmed down. beyond camp conversations, you can invite allies to camp meals, go on expeditions together, carry out camp chores, offer allies gifts, and plenty more. just don't expect romance this time, as support levels cap at a-rank. still, even if your relationships aren't always front and centre, i appreciated how three hopes ensures everyone gets their moment in this new setting, never forgetting what we loved about these characters. it's worth noting that you can't recruit characters from different houses before the timeskip, though select battles provide the option.

streamer rudeism, known for his weird and wonderful controllers and challenge run streams, has created a motion controller for sifu as his latest project and streamed the results over the weekend.



how does it work? he wears two gloves that have motion sensors and a stick in each hand for movement. simply punching the air is enough for light attacks, with other motions used for heavy attacks and parries, and then picking up items and other interactions are done by clicking in the sticks.

this is a minimalist city builder that is truly lovely to play with. rotate the pieces you're given, find homes for them, and then work out how to connect the next pieces that come along, how to make the most of their strange angles and how to eradicate any difficult gaps. it's a game that makes you fret endlessly over negative space.

slowly, though, it becomes clear that there is more going on. for one thing, play long enough just placing pieces and joining up edges, and you'll soon find yourself dropped into a game over screen. no matter. tile cities is one of my very favourite things - a game that you learn to play properly by playing it wrong, placing things, watching the ui do strange stuff, listening for sounds of discord as you progress, and slowly getting a sense of what the game wants.
