The game starts fairly linearly, but after the initial introduction (roughly half an hour or so?), the map opens up significantly. You'll come across towns, merchants, NPCs, skill checks, and quests aplenty. There's a surprising amount of lore to the world, and a fairly straight-forward leveling system.

2,117130415,english,"Dread Delusions borrows ideas from many classic RPGs and blends them up into something lighter, more digestible for a modern audience. It’s like The End of Dyeus, but focused more on being an Elder Scrolls like. It might look like Morrowind, but it only has the depth of something like Skyrim. You wake up as a prisoner and quickly learn that most factions in the game are disliked. That being said the game world is incredibly engrossing and I enjoyed scouring each floating island for delusions, the things that level you up. However, that brings me to my one real complaint about the game so far – it’s incredibly shallow as of right now in Early Access. The gameplay loop is simple - seeing a building on the horizon, killing or sneaking past enemies on your way to the building. Then killing something in the building, charming someone in the building, or using lore to use switches. Then upstairs or downstairs there’s a delusion and a chest containing some sort of monitory loot. Of course, this doesn’t apply to every house or tower in the game, but it’s a majority of them. Later in the game you find yourself looking for ore to upgrade your armor and weapons, and some NPCs hint that you should check out the mines that dot the countryside. You get excited to explore some abandoned mines – only find out that they’re just a hallway and a single room with no enemies that sometimes spawns ore. It’s a great game world that just doesn’t have a lot of variation of activities right now. Still, these are minor complaints that I hope are addressed in later areas. It’s a good game, and I’m excited to see where it goes.",2022-06-17 15:17:31,2022-06-17 15:17:31,True,19,1,0.7304089665412902,0,True,False,True,76561197972347621,792,81,402,402,251,1656011361,1574240,positive

9,117048345,english,"There's clearly a lot here even without the game being fully finished. The tutorial aspects are kept short and sweet and although the game gives you loose directions on where to go next, you have a lot of freedom after getting the ability to enter new islands, which really help with promoting player exploration of the world. Systems I've encountered so far are kept relatively basic, which I think works in favor of what the game is aiming to be. 

Controls are a bit unconventional but a quick read of the controls settings and its very easy to understand and or rebind. I think this is still a good thing, because the game is clearly trying to be older in style. 

Combat is very straight forward, but I don't think it has to be this grand spectacle. Spells and potions are fun to use and provide enough variety that it stays engaging enough. And the ability to upgrade weapons and armor is a nice touch.

Quests are interesting and unique so far with characters being personally tied to the quests they give you and are fun little stories, and so far the lore of these islands is really interesting and the unique environments and contraptions you can find provide a lot of wonder as to what is happening. Shops are also really neat and each of them fit their roles. Leveling up the skills provides a direct correlation to whatever you want to be best at, which works very well.

I called it a sort of midquel between Daggerfall and Morrowind, the sort of older style of Daggerfall but the inspiration and alien world of Morrowind.

The gameplay is fun but simple, spells are super interesting, combat is dodging based, physically moving yourself around enemies attacks as you jump back in to try and land another hit.

The lore and world are very very interesting, like genuinely so unique and fun. A world where a god-hating Inquisition rules that have deemed religion heresy. There is so much beneath the surface to discover as well, and everytime I entered a new location something new was there to suck me in. The world itself reminds me a lot of the excellent game Blasphemous.

12,117141760,english,"I want to start off by saying that while I do not recommend this game, I want to see it succeed very badly. I've been excited for this game for a while now and I can't wait to see where it goes.

The visual style is beautiful with obvious inspirations such as TESIII Morrowind and a personal favorite of mine Arx Fatalis. The retro-style graphics options are a nice bonus and nicely give an old school feeling without feeling like too much or looking like lazy filters. The UI is crisp and compliments the PSX aesthetic nicely. Inspirations aside, it appears that Lovely Hellplace has done a great job at creating their own complex and interesting weird fantasy world.

The majority of gripes I've experienced are concerned with gameplay. When I think of great open world RPG's the favorite ones that come to mind incorporate freedom as early into the game as possible while allowing for seamless optional tutorials. For example: In TESIV Oblivion you quickly escape the sewers and are welcomed into a large open world that is fully explorable. BUT, when you are let out into the world the devolopers point the character straight to a small dungeon that is completely optional but the player is enticed to go there since it's already straight ahead and so close. In New Vegas you leave Doc Mitchell's house and can go wherever you would like. Many players go without realizing that Goodsprings is an optional tutorial disguised as part of the open world. These types of beginnings in games allow for significantly cleaner replayability allowing the player to choose if they want to complete that first Ayelid ruin, Goodsprings, or Seyda Neen. Dread Delusion felt as though it was going that direction and nearly has it nailed barring a few things. It would be great have other options of escaping from the initial island as it would help demonstrate how different options are always available. Perhaps smuggling yourself off of the island somehow? Maybe you forge a pass to get over the barred bridge? Find someone on the island willing to barter for a pass? There's so much potential with the start of the game I would love to see fleshed out.

The combat so far is not great. dodging is fairly useless as sprinting backwards to strafe and kite enemies is significantly more effective. The use of stamina in this game is not good. You're maximum stamina decreases it's size the more you use it. The only way to get it back is by resting. On paper it doesn't sound that bad until you realize your stamina bar is cut in half after defeating a single enemy. I won't dwell on this topic that much as I've already read a post that a developer replied to stating they are looking into improvements to the stamina system. Magic is unfortunately significantly weaker than melee. In my playthrough I put as many points as possible into making an optimal spellcaster and found that a missile spell that takes a chunk of MP did less damage to the games weakest enemy than a single sword swing with an empty stamina pool. This realistically means that if you want to have fun right now your best bet is to ignore your stamina bar and kite enemies with a melee build. I personally find that kiting enemies in melee is actually pretty fun, I just want there to be other optimal options to choose from for spellcasters. I did not play around with the stealth system so I have no comments on it. However, lockpicking is not very fun as it relies on dice rolls that are additional influenced by your main attributes and lockpicking. It would be far more fun and engaging to have a lockpicking minigame even if it's a rudimentary one.

Dread Delusion is in need of a sound overhaul. Ambient sounds are minimal with the few I've heard only being noticed while in bushes. Having more ambient noises to compliment the beautiful visual design would vastly improve immersion with the game world. Other sounds effects being added would be nice such as a sound for unsheathing your weapon, interacting with many game world objects, footsteps, heavy breathing at low stamina/exhaustion, one-liner dialogue when interacting with npc's (not full voice acting), player character grunting upon receiving heavy damage, etc.

There are of course bugs as with any early access release but I did not experience anything game breaking enough to warrant creating a new save file. The most irritating bug I experienced was an enemies model turning invisible during combat and having to fight them based on audio and their floating weapon.

Dread Delusion shows extreme promise and I have no doubt that the developers at Lovely Hellplace will be working hard at making their vision a reality. The developers are already answering numerous questions in the steam community so they clearly are taking input to heart. Unfortunately, as of now the game is not worth $20 and I think they should have released just the tutorial island as a free demo before releasing the game into early access.

I love how intuitive the combat feels; you can physically dodge attacks and wait for openings, and that feels really nice. I haven't gotten a taste of the magic yet, unfortunately, though from the spell I saw in the store, it looks to be set around creativity, and that's always a good thing. Crafting items feels amazing so far. And talking to people is great; the dialogue is fairly organic and feels good to read through.
There are a couple things that could use a bit of adjustment. Fatigue seems to happen really fast; I like that it's a core mechanic, and I love that excessively using your stamina drains your max stamina, but it's pretty difficult to maintain at current level. I also feel like movement is a tad slow?

18,117055014,english,"I instantly fell in love with this game the moment I saw it pop up in my recommendation. The retro graphics, effects, and atmosphere melding together with surreal imagery and Lovecraftian horror makes for a strong visual foundation that itches my brain for exploring a lost forgotten game that was made back in the 90’s only for me to find in an attic 30 years later. I only recently started following the development for this project and the love and care that James Wragg to convince the player this is a living, breathing place of exploration and combat is inspiring. I’m highly anticipating this game’s full release, which is why I want to write this review to offer as much feedback as I can from my first experience to help this game grow to its fullest potential. This review may have some spoilers for events that happen in the game, so I will try my best to hide as much as possible that relates to a story, or just a cool moment I had.

I was engaged the moment [spoiler]I opened the cell doors to[/spoiler] begin my adventure in this bizarre colorful world. Though as I kept playing, I kept repeating the same statement over and over to myself when interacting with certain mechanics, which brings me to my first category of this review.

[h1]“Why won’t it just work?”[/h1]
As of 6/15/2022 I only have 3 hours in this game, and it’s very telling this is an early access release that has a lot of work needed to be completed. The foundation for a dynamic yet simple RPG elements are there but the cracks start to fold in when mechanics don’t really work as intended.

NPC do not follow you when asking them to follow you. They stand in place like a statue with no way to get them in gear.

Most, if not all hostile humanoid NPCs I interacted with do not move when attacked. They stand perfectly still and swing their weapons when I get close. The only ones that did move were surprisingly the bow and arrow bandits. 

All the monsters and non-human characters moved just find without any problem.

The Compass doesn’t work, and I was so sad when I sank my hard-earned gold into it just for the red needle not to move an inch.

Combat music for the first hour of the game was looping even when I wasn’t in combat. I had to mute the game’s music since it was so repetitive. It eventually stopped looping once I turned the music back on, but that lost me a lot of the immersion when settling into the world.

As of 6/15/2022 , those are the only notable bugs I encountered that breaks the games flow. These bugs were not frustrating, but more so a reminder that this is an indie game made by an individual and not a studio. Not everything is going to be perfect, and to demand perfection at this stage is not fair. However, there are a few questionable game mechanics in early game that slowly became a drag the longer I played. 
Which leads me to the next chapter:

[h1]“Fatigue is a drag and is not executed well early game.”[/h1]
Fatigue in this game is when your character gets physically tired resulting in attributes decreasing and your skills weakening. It’s harder to swing your sword, lockpick doors and chests, and speak to strangers using your charm. The longer you go without sleep and continue to drain fatigue by running, jumping, and attacking, the worse your stats get. Sleeping restored all stats and attributes just as expected. This mechanic was a welcome one in my first few hours of the game. It meant my character would need to find local inns, taverns, and cities to refuge at and gave me a reason to come back in to towns to check out shop items and see if there are new quests and secrets I missed. However, without knowing about [spoiler]Stamina potions[/spoiler] , you are completely reliant on [spoiler]spending mana to teleport to your last save point with the “hearthstone” spell you acquire in the first minutes of the game, which hopefully you set as the Wobblin Noggin inn since that is the only bed I was able to find after 3 hours of gameplay, then spending 2 coins each time you run out of fatigue and are forced to stop everything you was doing to go rest up if you are out of fatigue[/spoiler]. I assumed with a sleep mechanic I’d be able to stay in other’s beds, or abandoned beds that were left in the rubble of buildings. But none of the beds are interactable except for the one at the tavern. 

This becomes a non-issue later as you learn about [spoiler]Alchemy[/spoiler] and the ability to use the [spoiler]Academy’s teleporter system[/spoiler] , but having to pause everything you’re doing just to teleport back somewhere to pay 2 coins to refill a meter just to return back to that same spot to have enough charisma to talk to someone is… incredibly frustrating and time wasting. I hope that the Fatigue system is reworked or removed for something more traditional to depleting stamina. I am not a game designer and would not know a better replacement for such systems, but this was a big downer when trying to complete quests that required charm to progress early in the game’s beginner phase.

This game is early access. It is meant to be buggy right now because it’s a sneak peak at what’s to come. Despite the previously mentioned concerns above, I thoroughly enjoyed this game’s opening, the quests, and the world building revolved around it, and I can’t wait to play more when I get the chance. If you have the money to spare, PLEASE check out this game! The $20 price is worth it, and the value only grows as the game updates and receives all the fixes it deserves.

19,117421550,english,"I really like the idea of a non bethesda made first person rpg existing, and I like the artstyle and atmosphere of this game a lot, but there is a ton holding me back from appreciating this game in its current form, especially if it seems to explicitly hold as an aim capturing what makes those games compelling.

- The map is terrible. I know oldschool games had bad maps, but they were an accidental not essential component of them. In a game awash with misshapen technicolor mishmash, not having any way to concretely pin down locations or landmarks and your position relative to them is incredibly painful.

- I am not properly encouraged to engage with the world in any way other than vague quests or immediately visible collectibles. I understand wanting to make combat avoidance a viable way of progressing, but removing combat having any benefit at all, and making it so lockpicking, lore interactions, sneaking about etc. all do absolutely nothing, means I'm playing this game less like an open world arpg and more like Banjo Kazooie. 
The only way to progress is to collect Jiggies, and this is not fun both because it doesn't fit the game's intended playstyle and because I have no idea where they are other than ones I am apparently permanently content locked out of by not picking different stats.

- Combat is barebones, it's like modded daggerfall in a bad way. I circlekite and wait for space, then hit the enemy once or twice. Especially considering even the most basic enemies take 10+ hits, and I in no way improve in combat efficacy by fighting them, this makes the combat a chore. Yes there are charge attacks, and they do pretty much the same damage. There's simply not enough here to make it compelling, and as of yet no area I've encountered actually permits stealth combat as opposed to just stealth avoidance.

So this becomes my game experience thus far: 

I find myself aimlessly wandering around a mapless mishmash of color, making absolutely no progress of any kind regardless of how I interact with it. The world is bereft of cities, ruins, or locales, but merely has point of interest 'nodes' specked every so often. 

I come upon a POI node tower with a drunk soldier in it, my charisma check is too low to let me access the Jiggy held in the locked room below. The room is unlockpickable of course, and you are not allowed to kill or pickpocket him to get the key as characters don't have inventories and he's invincible for some reason. I make no progress and leave.

I begin wandering aimlessly again, I find another POI node with a wheelchair bound man with memory issues in it. There is a locked door upstairs that can only be opened by having enough book smarts to tug on candlesticks, meaning I can never access the precious Jiggy inside.
I go outside to a pillar and remember the man mentioning in bold that the pillar was made by people who hide things with illusion magic. I drink my truth seeing potion that specifically mentions that it interacts with such things that I found near a random lake nearby for absolutely no reason. Drinking the potion causes no changes to the pillar, it continues to not be interactable, but the sky changes color. The limited edition potion fades and the sky changes back. I make negative progress by wasting the potion and leave.

I come upon another POI node that is a tall tower with a Jiggy in the bottom again. The door at the bottom is unlockpickable as it is apparently barred from the inside. I prepare to leave, but then notice I might be able to get inside the top. I use my typically useless high agility stat to get 0 EXP by jumping up to a ledge to let me access the upstairs. Inside are three macguffins that require the lore stat to interact with, and no way of accessing the bottom of the tower with the Jiggy in it. I make no progress and leave.

I come upon a POI node with a wizard that has made several terrible spells and can't get into magic school. He tells me you need a letter of recommendation to get in. I get a quest telling me that people who can give letters of recommendation exist. Very oldschool, very cool. I make no progress and leave.

I visit what I vaguely remember is the lake area where I got the forbidden potion of truth seeing that did absolutely nothing at the designated use a truth seeing potion location. 
I decide to fight the giant version of a smaller enemy that lives there. After 10 minutes of waiting till he attacks then getting singular hits in, I get 0XP and he drops nothing. A notification appears onscreen telling me that Goblins, who already attack on sight, hate me more than usual now because I killed one of them that was big. I make negative progress and leave.

I do what I assume is backtracking but have no way to tell. I come upon a gap in two big rocks with an atheist soldier wandering about. He says I'm not cool enough to follow me around. I make no progress and leave.

I return to the POI node with drunk soldier inside, I have gained ore from somewhere now and want to try interacting with the previously useless furnace inside. The ore I have sucks and doesn't do anything. I make no progress and leave.

I wander aimlessly again. I continue to find arrows endlessly but no bow. I continue making no progress as nothing is lockpickable. I accidentally or on purpose retrace my steps constantly in a visually aggressive hellscape with no functioning map. I have not collected one single Jiggy aside from the one they use to explain what Jiggies are, I recall that I have not accomplished a single meaningful game act since the tutorial ended with the white haired lady saying my stat-penis was too small for me to be her sex slave. I turn off the game and cry.",2022-06-22 18:46:37,2022-06-23 20:20:59,False,6,2,0.5396860837936401,0,True,False,True,76561198012825255,566,33,149,149,149,1655928640,1574240,negative

It's got a lot going for it for an early access game. The art direction is downright inspired. It reminds me of some of the more horrific monster designs of Berserk.

Pros:
- World is well crafted and interesting to explore
- Good writing and compelling story
- Plenty of stuff to do and see
- Quests have different choices and are decently fun

Cons:
- Combat is trivial and not very engaging. Magic and Bows do so little damage they're worthless, Melee melts through any enemy without even upgrading the Strength-stat.
- Loot isn't very well balanced and there's not a lot to spend coin or materials on. You end up with way too many potions and lockpicks

Like navigating a nightmare, the visuals are a bad trip after reading Gothic Horror and Lovecraft.

The atmospheric feel cannot be understated.  

The lore and dialogue are alright. They probably need to polish this area as recycling and combining cliches doesn't exactly create a memorable experience. 

Audio is alright, but the repetitive music is on a short loop. I suppose my biggest criticism so far is the audio, as it feels like it repeats every 15 seconds depending on the area you're in.

As mentioned above, the experience is very similar to Morrowind; this holds true for the combat as well. Fairly easy to master, this grows fairly repetitive after the first few encounters. It is currently unbalanced in favoring a melee build but it appears that will change. 

There's clearly some kinks that needed to be worked out (lag time of enemy drops, enemies disappearing, items not working) but all things considered the game is still enjoyable even in early access.

There is not 1 quest that actually requires you to fight, and only 2 areas I found so far that were gated off till you defeated a couple of enemies. I'm glad I chose to build for Charm, Lockpicking, and later on Lore, because those are what truly gate things off. This is a worrying view of what's to come, quest design wise, if you're someone who actually enjoyed the little taste of combat demos or videos showed. Even then, combat is laughably easy. Stamina seems to not affect anything as far as I can tell, charging my swings never felt like it did more damage, I had more health potions than I could ever use, and enemy moves are telegraphed so hard that an old man could dodge them, but you're not an old man, you're Sonic the damn Hedgehog well before you even level Agility, you can outrun anyone without even pressing the shift key.

[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]

[h3]Visuals[/h3]
Pyreside is just a small village that is connected by a long bridge and thick woods. Despite having to explore the same areas throughout the years, you will notice some differences from time to time. New trees will grow in the woods, bedrooms will change based on the people who sleep there - there is always something worthy to note. What amazes me the most is when the game sets in winter. There aren't any paths that look obvious at first, but you'll instinctively know where to go since you have traversed the same path several times. The lighting helps to make the scene look dreamy and heartwarming at the same time, and the use of the blurred image of the town as a background indoors does a good job to make the scene look more beautiful. All in all, I liked the aesthetic approaches that are used in the game.

[h3]Story[/h3]
Meet Lyric. She was born as a child of an innkeeper, in a small mountain village called Pyreside. The outside is dangerous with monsters roaming around, so she never ventures outside. If this is another game, she'll be a hero that saves the world, but this isn't it. She's no fighter, and never will be. She only knows how to serve people, wash blankets, and talk to other villagers just like any other innkeeper. The game tries to emphasize more on that feeling, expressing how blessed she is with her life.

Although the premise sounds boring, the execution isn't. Poetic words fill the whole narrative, sending a brief, subtle message about what was happening. The voice dub is also brilliant - it brings weight to the narrative with the emotions showing up in it. The relaxing piano music portrays the slow-paced world perfectly, and just like the voice dub, the tune fits well with the atmosphere: cheerful times are accompanied by a strong, cheerful tune, while darker times are portrayed with a lower, subtle tune. My spirit was always lifted whenever the piano sound shifts into a more cheerful one. The combinations of these aspects help to bring the story to a greater height, showing the proper emotions when the time is right.

[i]Wayward Prophet[/i] did an excellent job in creating a heartwarming story in [b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/432010/Worlds_Dawn/]World's Dawn[/url][/b] ([url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198132503739/recommended/432010]my review[/url]), and [b]A Story Beside[/b] isn't any different. The story is a slow-paced one, full of heartwarming moments. You'll see how things and people change throughout the years: someone who looks grumpy all the time will eventually learn how to smile, characters being more mature as they grow up, things like that. What makes it more special is that the change doesn't feel forced at all. The main character will change her mindset as she talks to more people throughout the years, appreciates more what others did, and most importantly, cherishes the lives that matter to her the most. It's a sort of story that can make you feel emotional all the time.

[h3]The Game[/h3]
[b]Gameplay[/b]
As a story-heavy game, there isn't much to say about the gameplay. The game is divided into 7 chapters, where seven years passed between each one except the last. Each chapter lasts for one or several in-game days, which translates to around an hour in real life. Since the game is set in a village, you'll have to explore the same areas all the time, talking to all villagers and the interactable objects that you can find in every chapter. This can be annoying sometimes, especially since the main character has a slow walking speed. Some events will also require you to pick up objects lying on the ground, which are easy to find due to their blinking color.

There is a QTE in the game, but the delay between each action is very long. You don't have to worry about not being fast enough to press the button. Besides, there is no penalty - you can always press the buttons until you succeed.

I'm amazed at the amount of story branching that the game has. The changes are minimal, but that's the charm of the game: it's up to you to shape the story. Your decision will change a lot of things, whether it's your life or others, for the better or worse. Although some choices will take effect right away, others are more subtle, showing their repercussions a few chapters after. It's what I liked about the game the most. You need to pay attention to everything that the game has to offer and think of the possibilities.

[b]Length and Replayability[/b]
I finished the game in 7.9h, but I missed 2 achievements back then. The game offers a lot of replayability values from the story branching - I did try to play the game more after obtaining all achievements, but there are still a lot of possibilities that I can explore. However, the game doesn't seem to be designed with replayability in mind. Despite having a chapter select, there isn't a way to skip the cutscenes and you still have to deal with the slow walking speed. It fits with the slow-paced story, though. Somehow, I ended up appreciating the story more because of them.

[b]Others[/b]
Chapter select is only accessible after you load a save, which can be problematic if you accidentally load a save with a cutscene. There is also a chance of the game freezing after you alt-tab a lot, although it shouldn't be a problem as long as you save the game often.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
[b]A Story Beside[/b] is such a wonderful story to be had. The story gives a heartwarming feel to it, letting you appreciate whatever you have in the village. I ended up loving each character by the end of the story, even the one that I hated at first. Its message is delivered clearly, and the slow-paced story helps to set it up brilliantly. Those who enjoy heartwarming, emotional stories will enjoy the game, although I don't think it will appeal to others. Try checking the game's trailer - if you like it, especially the music, you won't be disappointed.

100,116107110,english,"After thoroughly enjoying Wayward Prophet's previous game, World's Dawn, I patiently waited for his next game, A Story Beside. I'm glad to say it was worth the wait.

The game pulls off its concept well, offering you the chance to experience an adventure RPG world from the perspective of someone else - an innkeeper of a small village of relatively little significance to the world. But to her, that village [i]IS[/i] the world. The decisions she makes throughout her life alters the village in small, yet notable ways.

Each chapter is a different part of Lyric's life, advancing years between each story. You often get choices in conversation and action, some of which are insignificant, some which can alter how the future plays out. I was invested enough to legitimately agonize over a choice or two, wondering if what I was doing was truly for the best. At the end of each chapter, you are given a summary of the choices you made, including ones you missed entirely. It made me very curious to try another playthrough to see how different things can end up.

Presentation is fantastic; the first chapter especially gives a great first impression with visuals and sound to immerse you in this fantasy world. Some parts are narrated by Lyric herself, and the voice acting is on point with feeling and with framing the current scene. One of my favorite details is the long, desolate bridge to the outside world. Most of the time, it's the only screen with a different perspective, with ominous sound effects and lack of music. It really encapsulates the intimidating feeling of venturing outside the only place you've ever known.

At first, I was frustrated by the lack of a run option, as many games like this would have one. However, I soon realized that this game didn't need one - this was a game to be taken slow, to be cherished for the time it asks. This is highlighted with the cliff with the view at the top of the village - you have the opportunity to stop and rest there every single chapter. This is a game to be savored.

Above all, the best part of the game is also the best part of World's Dawn: the characters and the dialogue between them are all perfect. I cared about the well-being of everyone Lyric grows up with or meets. People will enter and leave her life, for better or worse, and the ending is just beautiful.",2022-05-27 21:29:02,2022-05-27 21:29:02,True,1,0,0.525547444820404,0,True,False,False,76561197994494590,572,24,402,0,402,1653685757,634410,positive

Each battle takes way too long, and play out in the exact same way time after time. There's just not that much strategic depth to the game play in my opinion. Once you've gone through the first few levels, you've seen all the game has to offer strategically. Honestly, I think the constraint of unstoppable monsters really destroys the agency of the player.

115,116485582,english,"Not really my pace, but I'm still recommending it because there's nothing actually wrong with Kaiju Wars.

The visuals are charming and the music is pretty nice. If you like the idea of slowly building up resources to fight powerful kaiju, then check this game out when it's on sale.

However, despite no true flaws, I felt the pacing of the game to be too slow for my liking. The economy system feels like it makes things too gradual. When a kaiju is attacking your city, it seems odd to start building tanks and planes at that point. The military should be ready to go and not need to wait for individual dollars from the economy phase. I get that this is a usual trait of many strategy games, however, I feel like the money and unit deployment systems could have been streamlined a bit to make the game feel more exciting.

With that said, if you like slow-paced strategy games, then give this one a shot. The animations are all pretty nice and the gameplay is solid. I didn't care much for the dialogue or characters, but you might!

The plot and its cast is more for humour and to function as a framework for the game (which could otherwise just be a string of challenge stages with a simple text blurb at the start) but is rather decent & does its job in bringing amusement.",2022-06-16 15:16:04,2022-06-16 15:16:04,True,2,0,0.5321637392044067,0,True,False,False,76561198101122957,972,20,3079,2071,2828,1655555863,1508400,positive

And I love the sketchy 2d animation of the kaiju. They're hand drawn and a full good rate drawing FPS animation. (seriously they're really fun to watch)

Lots of potential when you play too cause you can upgrade units, get turn bonus cards.. even a local vs multiplayer with one person playing the kaiju! It's really well made.

EDIT: I tested the local multiplayer versus... it's actually very limiting to the second player (Kaiju player) So I can't recommend that mode. Think of it like the second player only gets to pick when there's a choice for the kaiju to do something. It's not a free roaming tactical versus thing for them while player 1 gets the free roaming. Maybe later on at the later levels maybe? or if someone makes a more multiplayer friendly custom map?

The game play is fun and challenging (especially after you progress in the game far enough) and the story consistently challenges me (to the point of frustration some times which kudos since not many games can do that to me and still make me want to play XD)

I HIGHLY recommend this game even at full price! If you are a fan of Kaiju it is even MORE fun. I hope this sells amazingly so we get some dlc. Would love to see some crossovers with kaiju franchises!

125,116024196,english,"Nice little horror game with about 60 to 90 minutes of exploration, but I was hoping for more of that signature Octavi Navarro twist - I think in the end the story didn't have much to offer. I mostly follow this developer for his pixel art and occasionally unique story, and the visuals are probably the best part of this game, at least compared to most horror games that are too dark and don't have enough unique objects. Well, there is a monster chasing you, she actually looks creepy considering its colorful pixel art, maybe a little uncomfortable to be around. You can pick from 3 different characters that have unique perks, but when one of them dies, you keep the progress like the keys and coins. As far as I can tell the game is timed, there is a mechanic which makes the monster more likely to find you, so you kinda have to plan ahead and use your consumables at the right time.

127,116022110,english,"First, I will say that there are several aspects about this game that I really do like.  The need to go quickly to find all of the cards required, versus not getting caught by the ""ghost"" does create a good amount of tension.  It reminds me of a lot of elements from the game The Horror of Salazar House, which I think the developers took some inspiration from, which is a good thing in my book.

The 3 different characters to choose from do add some element of strategy to the game, as based on their various traits, how you go about doing things first going in the house might differ.  It adds a little bit to the game's replay-ability, as you will probably need to play through the game several times just to both get an understanding of the game, and get familiarized with everything.

Also, I love the style and the sound in the game, as well as the cut-scenes, are very well done, and look very nice, setting up the atmosphere well.

That being said, a few areas where I think the game can be improved would be:

- Tweaking the ""ghost"" a bit, to be able to understand better where she is, in relation to your character, is needed.  While you can turn your character in-game to get some clue from the audio of the ghost as to where she might be, a lot of times, it just felt like she was either constantly near me, or very far away.  This makes the hiding element of the game feel a little unhelpful, as you can't easily determine when hiding, where the ghost while doing so.  Multiple times, I would hide, listen for any sound I could, only get out of my hiding spot just to have the ""ghost"" be right there still in the room.

Also while I think they did a good job on the audio, a little more variety in sounds the ghost makes would be nice, and give a bit more tension while playing.  After hearing the ghost do nothing but basically sing throughout my several playthroughs, it got a little old to hear, and brought down the scare factor just a bit.

- I'm not sure how much a person would play the game once they beat it.  Now to be fair, I haven't beaten the game yet, but as of right now, I don't see much else that would give you much reason to come back to it after you've finished it, other than maybe trying to beat it with a certain character, or to try and not have any characters fail at all, etc..  Overall though, for the price right now, I'm not sure it will give it's value back, playtime-wise, for a lot of people.  It feels more like a game that should be more like $4-5 tops at the moment.

- The different story items you can find throughout the house, should be in a place you can go back and look at them from the main menu.  I don't know if the characters' ""sweat level"" keeps going up while viewing these various story items in-game, but the way the game plays, I didn't ever really stop to pay too much attention to them, fearing I was needing to move quickly.  A little gallery in the main menu, maybe after completing the game, or just after finding each story item, would be nice for people to get a better idea of the background story, without needing to feel rushed to read each of these items during your in-game playthrough.

- Changing the set locations where key items you need to find, to instead be more randomized each game, would be nice.  Again, if the purpose of the game is to be more of a game that you play until you beat, thus being more of a limited but fun short game experience...then not randomizing the location of certain items, like a key, is fine.  

But again, the price point makes me feel that it should cost a little less than $7 if that's the case, as once you get the gist of the game, with a little practice, you should be able to get through it consistently I feel, without too much difficulty (but again, I haven't beaten the game yet so maybe there's more replayability to it that I haven't gotten to see yet?)

- Finally, and this is just my own personal small gripe...the x-ray specs you buy from the merchant, either don't seem to help much, or I just am not very attuned as to what I am supposed to look for, or see, while using them.  Occasionally, I'd see items through various searchable areas with them, but most of the time, I couldn't really tell when something searchable contained anything.  Even if I could, I couldn't make out what exactly that thing was.  Again, this could be just me, and maybe they aren't supposed to be too powerful, as that would possibly make things too easy, but I think the x-ray specs, and what they show to help save you time searching through everything, need a little bit of work to make them of any real help.

Overall, I am enjoying playing through the game, and have had fun, but I worry how much I'll be compelled to play it ever again after it's beaten.  The developers clearly did a great job with the visuals and sound, and you can see the love for making their game is there... I just worry that it may be priced too high right now, for the amount of gameplay you actually get, to warrant a purchase for most people.

I think this game is fantastic. The story and art style are awesome plus it has some great horror elements. I think it is for sure worth playing. I did have two issues with it though. The first is that it's kinda hard to tell where the ghost is and when you hide you can't hear at all if she has left or not. The other issue was a game breaking bug that kept happening in the upstairs bathroom. Every time the ghost came in while I was in there I would get stuck and unable to leave or do anything. Other than that I loved it.

[h1] Review [/h1]
[b] Summary - [/b] Uninvited is about three kids who are trying to find 13 zombie cards from one of their brothers who hid them in this mysterious house. Little did the kids know, A dark presence lives in the home. The further you get into the house, the more you will uncover and learn the dark past of the home.

[b] Story - [/b] The Story in Uninvited is actually really interesting and engaging. You wander into this mysterious house and you learn the history of the occupants who lived here. It’s a pretty tragic story and is really well put together. It has a dark story and gives me some Monster House vibes which is also a plus. A really unique story and pretty refreshing for a horror indie game.

[b] Gameplay - [/b] The gameplay is pretty good. You have three playable characters with different traits that can make it easier or harder. You have only three lives to complete the game so if one of the playable characters die, you have to switch to one of the other characters. It’s a pretty cool mechanic on how they do it to be honest. You can buy some items to help you make it just a tad easier which is a cool mechanic as well, even though it kinda doesn’t make sense. I find it kinda silly that you have a deadly spirit in the house but hey, let me feed it some chocolate so it will leave me alone for a short while. Or use body spray to stop you from sweating so the ghost can't track you. It’s pretty comedic in a way, but I guess we can mark it off as unique. The hiding mechanic is pretty bad in my opinion. You have no idea if the ghost is nearby or not as you can only hear your heartbeat. Now if the ghost is right up your rear end before entering the closet, you can hear it knock and breathe so once you only hear your heartbeat, you are free to get out of the closet. I’m not a fan of how they did the hiding mechanic. Like if the ghost saw you enter the closet, you would think it would just open it and grab you. But hey, only if you have a high sweat meter you have a risk of that happening. Probably my only complaint about this game.

[b] Graphics - [/b] I love the graphics for this game. It's a very unique 2.5D kinda style. It truly gives you this Indie horror vibe to it and looks pretty scary. The lighting from your light source is good. The image is sharp and easy to see the environment. Honestly the art style drew me in to buying this and was not disappointed at all.

This is a much bigger and bolder game than its predecessor with a larger world, Metroidvania elements, and far more complex roguelike and RPG mechanics meant to add as much depth as possible to every run, and it is all the better for it. Unlike the original, every character has their unique move set and weapon attributed to their class instead of just stat changeups in the original, this change removes so much monotony that could be found in the mid-game of Rogue Legacy and replaced it with a far higher skill ceiling where every run will you feel as though you accomplished at least one thing. The controls are also far tighter with the Sun Tower area showing off how great the platforming is with some small additions to every hero's move set.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2812564745

	Whether by fate or chance, my huge family tree includes an impressive quantity of Lady Susies. Somehow, they always manage to progress our multi-generational quest more than any other nameholder. You see, everyone in our family knows that they’re headed for a violent, early end - and they do it anyway. Our legacy is blood - although the ever-shifting maze repopulates with every death we incur, we press on, discovering new areas and killing the boss in each of them. Our legacy is gold, too, allowing our offspring to develop new wings to our castle, buy and upgrade gear and runes before they, in turn, hop towards the dungeon’s entrance for one last descent…
	Rogue Legacy 2 is the sequel to Cellar Door Games’ 2013 roguelike indie gem, visually upgraded while maintaining the specific appeal of the original: a 2D romp in which you have to make situational use of your dashes, double jumps, spin kicks and class abilities until you master the knowledge and reflexes required to clear areas and finish the game.
 
	The controls are tight and responsive - and you’ll be happy that is the case, as you’ll have plenty of opportunities to practice your platforming skills. Aside from the usual dodging and dancing around projectiles, most of the game’s runes are locked behind challenges requiring you to achieve certain feats in order to loot chests that melt if you fail. I highly recommend using a controller for Rogue Legacy 2, as the alternative use of abilities makes great use of the triggers while the aiming-oriented classes feel natural to control using two joysticks, giving off strong run-and-gun vibes when playing the Gunslinger, specifically.
Speaking of classes, you’ll have plenty of styles to explore: your characters can have one of fifteen different “professions” (with unlockable alternates you can unlock with souls, a currency that drops from bosses). Although they all fall under three major categories (melee, ranged or caster) there are significant playstyle differences between them: the Chef, for example, can return most projectiles in a volley with his pan and his self-healing class ability ensures a lot more resilience while exploring - as opposed to the Boxer, for example, who despite also being a melee warrior has a much more rushdown-oriented playstyle, increasing his damage as he achieves a higher combo counter. 
   

[h1]A World of Pain[/h1]

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2812564349

The underground dungeon you have to explore is randomized with every death, but retains a general sprawl of six different areas, each with their own boss and thematic enemies. Traps, resolve management, “fatal” artifacts, spikes, enemies will kill you over and over again, but there’s a clear sense of progress and a drive to not repeat mistakes that keeps you going forward. There’s enough mechanical depth and variety to keep you going for a lot longer than the thin-paper plot and scarce worldbuilding. The art direction is consistent and makes great use of tones to convey mood in every area: from the horizontal, side-scrolling sprints through Axis Mundi (the second area) to the tight vertical platforming of the Sun Tower, there’s a lot of memorable moments empowered by the craft and sweat of the artists who conceived this world.
	By the time you’ve cleared your first playthrough, the game will seem fairly easy - whether because you have quick reflexes and a good grasp on how to avoid damage, or because you’ve dumped literal tonnes of gold, ore and aether into your castle wings, runes and gear. No matter - in true roguelike fashion, New Game+ includes a plethora of handicaps you can activate, a Prime mode for every boss (an improved version of them), which you have to finish numerous times in order to reach the game’s “true” ending, and no matter how much you upgrade at one point you’ll simply have to learn the actual dance.

	https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2812564527

	An aspect that often defines a roguelike’s life expectancy is how grind-oriented it is, and Rogue Legacy lets you take a pretty relaxed approach to it. There are bottlenecks, of course, but most of them are simply skillchecks. Sure, you can spend an hour or two doing gold runs and filling up your coffers before you engage the same boss with more damage, mana and a larger health pool, but you’ll probably be faster just trying out the bossfight until you can do it perfectly. I never felt like I was being held back by raw values as much as I was incorrectly using the screen space and abilities to avoid incoming damage, which is what boss fights are all about. In that regard, you can avoid grinding altogether if you’re quick and fast learning enough.
	The colorful, cartoonish graphics and genre-savvy music and sounds are exactly as shown on the cover - a modern, less pixelated facelift applied to the style and vibe of the original title. The design is clear and projectile types are often color-coded, while enemy types directly reference the designs of skeletons and floating mages I oddly remember from playing the first game almost eight years ago. 
	Rogue Legacy 2’s strength is its gameplay. It’s fun whether tackled in small or big sessions and while its sense of novelty will wear out quickly, you’ll find yourself playing long after that, fueled by its engaging platforming elements and fast-paced combat. It’s admirable how balanced and fine-tuned the game is - almost as if it knows when to spike up the difficulty in order to motivate you - and it allows a soft sliding difficult scale through its House Rules feature, a customizable difficulty panel ensuring that even newcomers to the genre can see the adventure through.

224,116269915,english,"Starts out great, fun like the first game. And then the game keeps going. And escalating in frustration. Gold costs for upgrades scale so fast that grinding earlier areas for an advantage is worthless and enemies in the later stages can kill you in a second. It makes the game feel unfair in a way the original wasn't, and the feeling that you ""could"" win the game even with base stats is completely gone. I wish that the heirlooms and artifacts didn't feel like such minuscule bonuses. Dying pointlessly a half-dozen times to earn a 1% health bonus while waiting for an heir that has a useful set of abilities just doesn't feel good.",2022-05-31 02:32:01,2022-05-31 02:32:01,False,10,0,0.5933831334114074,0,True,False,False,76561198005616069,743,21,1369,0,1369,1653963170,1253920,negative
225,116714556,english,"Rogue Legacy 2 is an excellent follow-on from the first. Some of minor annoyances from the original have been dealt with and the game caters to a broad spectrum of play styles and ability levels.

The number of areas has increased from 4 to 6 and the areas feel unique, rather than reskins of the same template. One zone in particular has a lot of verticality which is great fun for those into platformers. There are also exploratory side missions that rewards you with additional lore, bonus challenges, and damage buffs against bosses. 

The classes in the original were more-or-less the same, just with different stats, but that's not the case now. Each class plays completely differently. I really enjoyed the boxer who has a combo meter and can float in the air while their rapid punches are making contact with the enemy! Additionally, there is an ability fairly early in the game which can lock a class to one of your heirs, so if there's a particular class you really enjoy, then you can keep using them. Although bear in mind that there are rewards for using a variety of classes in the form of stat bonuses.

You will always be in a situation where you can progress. In the original, I sometimes found myself having a series of bad runs and never having the money to upgrade abilities. That's no longer the case now as there is a magic safe that will store a small proportion of your money before you start a new run. So even if you have a series of bad runs, you will eventually have enough money to upgrade something.

You can progress through the NG+ at your own pace. I won't give away too much about NG+, but if you feel like you have bitten off more than you can chew, you can dial it back at any time. 

A few minor things about the game:
-I miss the circus minigames from the original. I'm guessing they would have been a bit of an atmosphere killer in this, but it would have been nice to have an alternative. I suppose some of the charm chest rooms were similar, but I enjoyed the lighthearted respite in the original!
-I liked the miniboss trap room in the original (with the Doomvas) and I was kinda hoping there would be more of that kind of stuff in this one.

And one tiny annoyance:
-The UI in the Scars of Erebus is a bit awkward. It would be nice for the cursor to remember which challenge you were on (for when you're retrying the same challenge) and it would be nice if there was an easier way to check individual class scores for each challenge rather than having to press 'Y/Triangle' over each scar. (E.g. Have a table that has the classes as rows, scars as columns, with all the scores in the cells, and totals at the end. This is so you can quickly check which classes/challenges have been neglected).

Aside from that, a solid 9/10 for me! Thanks guys, well worth the wait :)

226,116615938,english,"Amazing game. Perfect blend of Roguelite mechanics, platforming, progression and puns.

Gameplay Loop:

1) Select from a list of 3 characters. Each characters usually have a bonus or a negative trait (which give a gold bonus) attached to them.
2) Get ready for your adventure the usual way (shopping, equipping runes, talking to NPCs, playing mini games)
3) Explore the castle visitng various stages. This allows you to progress the storyline, get various types of currency, get artficat, etc
4) Did you die? Did you killed the last boss? If so, go back to 1. 

Why I whole heartily recommend this game:
- The difficulty is great. I felt the game was a perfect blend of frustrating and fun. If you don't like game where you are award for pattern recognition then this game might not be for you. Plus in the NG+ mode you get a Hade-like select the buffs the enemy get. 
- The grinding isn't there. you might hear about the grinding in this game and I'm here to tell you it isn't true. If you're good then you don't need to grind but if you're not so good (like me!) or just like experimenting then you get rewarded with your failures. I never felt grinding was a means to an end.
- Movement powers. The dashes, air dashes, air stomp and double jumping(+) feels really good. 
- The hit box in this game is well done. It's a weird thing to mention but the hit box seems to be perfect. There was never a time that I thought I got hit when I shouldn't. This isn't a big thing but you'll never know how much you miss it until you play a game with a bad hit box.
- Progression system. So much stuff to unlock and explore. Even when you die, you feel like you got something for it. 

100% achievement takes around 80 hours? Probably less if you're good at this type of game. 
Honestly I wasn't trying for achievement in this game I was having such a good time. It sorta of just happened.

227,116646364,english,"From the devs of one of the few examples of procedural Roguelite done right, comes an example of... procedural Roguelite done better. There is no other way to slice it - Rogue Legacy 2 is just Rogue Legacy 1, but bigger and more polished.

You're still picking a new heir with different quirks for each run, still going trough a randomly-assembled dungeon collecting cash, and still spending that cash on permament upgrades in between rounds. Your goal is still to defeat each of the bosses one at a time, until you unlock the final one and move on to New Game+. The nitty-gritty in between, however, is where the game was expanded substantially.

There is a bigger emphasis on movement abilities, which you will unlock in the course of runs, metroidvania-style. Each class now has its own unique weapon and playstyle, expressed in a far deeper stat system. A new relic system adds lots of wacky twists and modifiers to each individual run, which you will need to experiment with to prepare for the far more complex bossfights. All done in much better visuals and sound.

But the usual trappings of Roguelite still apply - there will be instances of deep frustration with the RNG, as well as times where you feel like you're just spinning your wheels on the gold grind. Many a run will end prematurely simply because you decided to try a new thing, and screwed yourself over. And then of course you will get that one ""god run"" that feels ecstatic.

230,116648102,english,"I wish I could rate this just okay or so-so. Rogue Legacy 2 certainly has more than the original Rogue Legacy, but it's not necessarily more GOOD. The more I play it, the more I am led to believe that the developers were never entirely sure what lightning in a bottle they captured that made the first installment so successful, and as a result have simply dialed up everything to 11 hoping that something will stick. There's more classes, weapons, skills, enemies, etc., but there's ten times the amount of garbage you will have to deal with experiencing it.

The grind is obviously part of the experience of this game, and is put front-and-center with the iterative upgrades you buy after each run attempt, but feels orders of magnitude worse than the previous title. The risk-reward proposition in this game is abysmal. The game will highly discourage you from taking any risks and instead you will quickly find that you will amass much more treasure and experience by steamrolling lower-difficulty areas over and over rather than attempting somewhere more challenging, where you will eventually be killed in two or three hits. Damage can come from anywhere, and projectiles often move faster than you can react, with projectiles or traps coming from offscreen to whittle a third of your health down after you've already scoped out your plan for things on the screen. The end result is often expending your mechanical resources of an extra jump or dash to cleanly eliminate what is on screen, but now that you air in midair and have those mechanics disabled until you touch down, you can easily be tagged by new things that have entered the screen after executing your plan. Normally having to react to things is such a standard part of video games that it seems almost ridiculous to mention something like this at all, but it will happen to you SO MUCH in RL2 that it bears mention. You WILL be tagged by things coming from offscreen, you WILL be hit by attacks that make no sense, and you WILL die to BS, over and over again. To some people, this grind can be exciting, as it becomes more akin to gambling, hoping to get lucky and not spin bankrupt rather than outplaying the enemies, but to me I find it tedious.

Enemy telegraphs in this game are abysmal, and I don't mean in the ""enemy makes a windup motion and then you react"" sense. I mean, an enemy will clearly show that they are executing some sort of attack, but instead of it being something you can safely react to or learn from, it will suddenly be a fast-moving projectile that will shoot through walls to hit you. Why does an enemy who only appears to have a melee weapon have an attack like this? Why do some projectiles go through walls and others don't? There's dozens of overengineered mechanics in this game ranging from several kinds of weights and how they affect what you can pick up without ruining your max health, down to several currencies, bonuses, debuffs, and all these things which should really just be taking a backseat to the hack and slash mechanics. I doubt many players care that their new armor gives them plus seventeen smeerps instead of fifteen, when the areas you want to explore will still kill you in three hits. The upgrades are so incrementally tiny, it feels like garbage even sinking points into any of them at all.

There's simply so much crammed into this game that don't strictly make it better that bothers me. There's lore books shoehorned in in the most hamfisted manner, sidequests which are vague enough that even when you know exactly what a riddle is referring to, you will still fail because you were standing two inches too far away to trigger a secret door. Just google this stuff, it's legitimately not worth trying to solve the riddles, especially since it just leads to more ways to obtain more nonsense currencies that let you buy more tiny upgrades, seriously, sometimes simplicity is better.

Multiple runs in this game are tiring and overtly repetitive, something that is not good for a roguelite or any game that has ""rogue"" so brazenly spotlit in the title. I want to experience all this game has to offer but this gameplay loop is trying my patience and you can get about triple the dopamine per run in many other similar roguelites. RL2 isn't bad, it's not great, and it really is just about as okay as RL1, with a more convoluted path to the golden gameplay loop that seems to take the backseat. Sometimes simplicity is best, and I honestly feel stripping about 50% of the stuff from this game would make it objectively a more fun experience.",2022-06-07 20:39:33,2022-06-07 20:39:33,False,5,0,0.557375431060791,0,True,False,False,76561198001528028,617,14,1974,573,991,1655242318,1253920,negative

233,116714389,english,"[b]TL;DR[/b] Foundationally great game, brought down by a lot of smaller issues. If youre looking for a solid rogue-like to grind out, its not a bad choice for a game. However if youre experienced in these sorts of games you might find a lot of smaller things that will hinder your enjoyment.



MILD GAMEPLAY SPOILERS AHEAD

This isn't really a ""not recommended"" but as steam doesnt have a mid option, this is what im going with.

this one hurts, genuinely. Rogue Legacy 1 is a game i still hold dear to my heart as it was the first game that i consciously played as an ""Indie Game"" and got me started to look deeper into smaller games. (i think it also was my first rogue-like, but not 100% if i didnt play BoI first)

So let me start this out by saying this: If you're looking for a foundationally solid rogue-lite experience with great art and some quirks, this game is not a bad choice by any means, and you can certainly have fun with it.

However, while I replayed RL1 a bunch of times, including beating the game in just a couple generations and going into NG+[high number i dont remember] , at some point i decided to just get through the rest of the game and be done with it, and now that im done, i have no desire to ever open it up again and very mixed feelings if i actually enjoyed these 18 hours.

[b]1) Professional Polishers[/b]

So where are the issues? Honestly, Its hard to pin down but there are a lot of smaller things that add up. Like already said, the graphics are great, the foundation is solid, the controls are responsive, the basic combat is polished...

...but here we come to our first and main type of issue: Everythings just a little too polished. I firmly believe that rogue-likes are a genre that shouldnt be polished too much. It requires unbalanced things, it requires quirky moments, it requires useless but fun roads to go down. Binding of Isaac is maybe the most unbalanced rogue-like ever and maybe the greatest, so that should tell you somethings. The nature of it is that it builds on randomness and variety.

Heres an example of what i mean: RL1 had traits that made the game way harder (think vertigo) for no compensation whatsoever. Does that mean vertigo was a bad addition to the game? I would argue no, i still picked a vertigo character occasionally for funsies. RL2 meanwhile introduces welfare, meaning you get a percentage money bonus depending on how bad a trait is. No more funsies, now thats a balanced tradeoff. (it also feels like theres way less traits, the amount of times ive looked at my options and all 3 had no traits was baffling to me)

This extends to other parts of the game as well. Another Example: You have a relic system thats expanded way beyond what RL1 had just so you can give the player 10% bonus damage in certain situations. Also you can only have so many relics before your HP takes a hit, how much is correlated to your equipment. Why have it be this advanced and then barely affect the gameplay? Except for 1-2 runs the relics felt absolutely pointless.

Locking class, rerolling and more options so you can always have pretty much the exact character you want! sounds great right? until you realize it ruins the variety of the game while being the theoretical best play.

[b]2) Metroidvania?[/b]

The game tries to go into the metroidvania direction but leaves very little room for exploration early on. you get an heirloom, you unlock one new area, where you get an heirloom that unlocks the next area... The game even straight up tells you ""this is area number X"".

It feels like its being done just for the buzzword and less for its actual contribution to the gameplay. And its made worse by...

[b]3) Grinddddddd [/b]

Now i wanna reiterate that while i make it sound like these are massive fuckups each and every one, none of them are by themselves. If this game for example only had issues with too balanced relics and traits, it would still be a great game. And similarly to the next point: There are definitely grindier rogue-likes out there. However, unless you bang your head against a wall like I did in the end, you'll likely still have to grind. And its just not rewarding. Why exactly is hard to pin down, but i think it comes from the overwhelming amount of things to invest in vs. what you can actually manage in a NG and the in comparison to that fairly quick price increase. Also going back to polish, i noticed in the beginning that with the same money bonus i always ended up with pretty much the exact same amount of money after clearing the citadel out +-100. Which sounds brilliant on paper, but makes the grind even less exciting.

I beat RL1 in just a couple generations without too much issue. This here feels impossible (im sure it isnt actually). It makes the grinding feel mandatory, while in RL1 it felt like an option to make it a bit easier.

[b]4) Variety until there isnt [/b]

Riddle me this: In a sequel, whos main difference is that different classes now have different weapons that work completely differently, why have XP per class? That just points towards maining 1-2 classes and ignoring the rest. Again, the bonus you get from XP is fairly miniscule, like everything here its a minor point, but it pushes you in the imho wrong direction.

Another issue personally is that due to enemies tendency to run into you, classes that didnt allow moving while attacking/stunned you for a second when attacking felt really static and unfun in comparison, which again made me wanna limit myself to just a few classes. For a while i forced myself to pick the other ones regularly but eventually i gave up on that towards the end.

[b]5) combat [/b]

so you have like 4 ways to counter projectiles in a somtimes bullet hell-like game where positioning matters and you have to keep track of mana, skill cooldown, etc.. It gets overwhelming sometimes. Which would be fine in most games but again, it a rogue-lite, a genre which is about just playing until it works, its imho the wrong decision to complicate things so much.

[b]6) and lots of lots of other small things [/b]

so i dont write an essay heres a rundown of more smaller things that bothered me:

[list]
[*] I dont have anything to base it on but it felt like there were just as many different enemies and rooms in RL2 as there were in RL1 while RL2 is a bigger game
[*] half the bosses are quite neat, half arent
[*] i hunted for fairy chests and spent a bunch on being able to find more runes and still struggled to fill out the rune weight i could carry with runes i wanted
[*] why are iron and blood currencies a thing? 
[*] Some of the dialogue is long winded and tries too hard to be funny imo
[*] heirlooms apparently have a personality each just so they can speak... 2 sentences?
[*] wtf is the difficulty spike from area 4 to 5
[*] some of the side content like the is unsatisfying and just not that fun
[*] ...
[/list]

i could go on but i leave it here. I hope you get the point. None of these points would be enough. Theyre all fairly miniscule but just add up. Im not surprised a lot of people enjoy the game, but i sadly dont, even though i really wanted to.",2022-06-09 09:21:16,2022-06-09 09:21:16,False,3,0,0.544684886932373,0,True,False,False,76561198055030360,944,16,1109,0,1109,1654758126,1253920,negative

236,117371145,english,"So, let me start off by saying that I wanted to finish the game twice before giving this review, just to make sure its not just my initial excitement talking. What I want to say is that this game has been designed to be completed. Its not designed to frustrate or waste your time. The reason that I say this is that for every mechanic that makes this title roguelike, there is an unlock you can purchase by playing the game, and making the experience less random and more focused on progressing.

Now to continue I will try to explain what I mean by ""designed to be completed and not waste your time"" to the best of my ability, with the mention that the review contains spoilers, and you can always youtube this and get a tutorial or just see general gameplay.

The mechanics of the game are as follows: every run you get a random map and 3 random heroes to choose from (with your options increasing as you unlock more classes. You can obtain 4 types of resources: gold, blood, ore and soul. At the start of each run (following your death) you have to give your gold away (or portion of it) but you keep all blood, ore and soul and everything you unlocked, including passive experience gains, gear, runes, etc.

Now, as you progress, you unlock mechanics to counteract the randomness of the game, such as: 
- very close to the start of the game you unlock the ""Arhitect"" which will lock the world in place as many runs as you want, at an increasingly tax on your gold gains. I use this a lot to focus on a specific boss, because the valuable resources the boss drops are not affected by the Arhitect penalty, just the gold gain. 
- teleporter at the start of each biome unlocked permanently to allow you to focus on a specific biome. I try to unlock the Axis Mundi permanent teleporter due to the passive 20% gold gain and somewhat easy map.
- the ability to start various challenges as many times as you want which in turn reward the Soul resources. With the Soul resource you unlock permanent option to lock any class you want in place with any secondary ability you choose, and many other useful things, such as the ability to toggle between weapons for most classes, or be able to drop higher tiers of gears and runes, and many more 
- 6 most recent backup saves.  I use this if I get really good modifiers on a specific character, like +50% weapon damage, and I try to progress in a boss fight.


In the end of this review I want to mention that for me, for my style of play, I felt respected as a player and my time valued.
I usually stay away from wasting my time with roguelikes and roguelites because I feel most of them are designed to frustrate and create a fake ""skill barrier"" which is actually empty content and lack of ideas wrapped under a toxic ""be pro or get out"" banner.

I guess if any game were to do it, it'd be Rogue Legacy's sequel. If you liked the first game, buy this right now. It's nothing but improvements over the original. Graphically, it looks stunning, it's absolutely addicting, controls amazingly, and the post game content is very fun too. I'm on NG+2 right now and it's really fun to blitz through the game while setting new gold records every other run.

All of the new features are extremely well implemented. Spin kicking is such an amazing mechanic, and it honestly makes me never wanna go back to the first game. If you've played Isaac- you know how Binding of Isaac: Rebirth basically made the original Flash Isaac redundant? Yeah, we've got another case of that. Seriously, what an improvement over the original.

It's easily a contender for one my favorite Roguelikes, and trust me, I play a [i]lot[/i] of Roguelikes. It's got everything you'd want from a sequel, and even if you haven't played the original, what you've got here is an extremely well made Roguelike platformer. 

The only bad thing I have to say about it is that I think the writing is a little eh. Too many pizza jokes. Plus the story doesn't make sense unless you literally read the lore bible the game slowly dumps on you as you play.

264,116254693,english,"Very fun rogue-lite metroidvania.  It improves upon the original in every way, particularly the introduction of multiple classes that all play quite a bit different.  The excellent core game remains: you run a castle until you die, then an heir takes over with bonuses from your prior runs, with a new randomized version of the castle.

273,116701078,english,"Overall, I'm really enjoying this game. I would give it a solid 8/10 and I'll probably put another couple dozen hours into it. The platforming feels great, the combat is snappy, and each new biome has a nice hook to keep things interesting. And there's definitely a lot of content if you're looking for a good grind.

However, I will say that enjoying this game requires resetting some expectations - although it's structurally very similar to a lot of roguelikes out there, it has a very different ""feel."" Most importantly, it's not really a build-focused game, even though it looks like it should be one. You might occasionally get a perk or relic that matches up really well with something else, but there's nowhere near the depth you would find in something like Dead Cells or Risk of Rain. It's much more about the classes, which is totally fine for me because there are so many of them and they all have nice differences in how they play. 

Secondly, it's a lot more like a side-scrolling ARPG (except for the build crafting, like I said) than a traditional Metroidvania platformer. Individual enemies have very basic attacks and patterns; it's less about engaging with any particular enemy and reacting to their actions, and more about managing larger groups and using abilities in fairly well-defined cycles. Again, I had no problem with this, but you're going to be disappointed if you want something more Dark Souls or Dead Cells (parrying, blocking, rolling, etc).

Finally, the actual ""gimmick"" of the game, the ancestor system, is really not as important as you might think. 90% of a run will be determined by the class you pick, while the genetic traits are usually pretty minor. I almost wish some of the other mechanics had been eliminated and repurposed as additional genetic traits, because right now the game feels a little light in that area - which is weird, because it's sorta the whole point of the game!

But don't let these things scare you off - it's still a really fun game that has a ton of polish and a ton of content. Just go in on the game's terms instead of assuming it'll be like games that *look* the same and I think you'll enjoy it.",2022-06-09 00:42:39,2022-06-09 00:42:39,True,1,0,0.5090909004211425,0,True,False,False,76561197979563122,589,71,2329,504,1769,1655778354,1253920,positive

Sadly, I thought this was just a bit too brief to really have a lasting impact (and I do personally enjoy very short games a lot) and the writing could do with a lot of touch ups - there's a few missing commas and everything feels a bit amateurish, especially the text for news articles

My main issue though, to put it bluntly, is that I was not very good at this. The gist is, for each person, you're given a brief description of their problems and a handful of memories. You have to delete one to try and shift their future. I was getting almost all of them wrong and didn't really know what the game wanted from me in most cases. It's not very obvious what your choices will do and from what I can tell, there's only one save file, so you have to restart if you want to try different choices

This didn't completely sour the experience though, it's still a solid narrative! I just wish it had a bit more polish to it

I guess if any game were to do it, it'd be Rogue Legacy's sequel. If you liked the first game, buy this right now. It's nothing but improvements over the original. Graphically, it looks stunning, it's absolutely addicting, controls amazingly, and the post game content is very fun too. I'm on NG+2 right now and it's really fun to blitz through the game while setting new gold records every other run.

All of the new features are extremely well implemented. Spin kicking is such an amazing mechanic, and it honestly makes me never wanna go back to the first game. If you've played Isaac- you know how Binding of Isaac: Rebirth basically made the original Flash Isaac redundant? Yeah, we've got another case of that. Seriously, what an improvement over the original.

It's easily a contender for one my favorite Roguelikes, and trust me, I play a [i]lot[/i] of Roguelikes. It's got everything you'd want from a sequel, and even if you haven't played the original, what you've got here is an extremely well made Roguelike platformer. 

The only bad thing I have to say about it is that I think the writing is a little eh. Too many pizza jokes. Plus the story doesn't make sense unless you literally read the lore bible the game slowly dumps on you as you play.

But, yeah! Worth the full price. Early access did this game wonders, like holy hell. I was not expecting it to be this good!

The platforming feels great, the combat is snappy, and each new biome has a nice hook to keep things interesting. And there's definitely a lot of content if you're looking for a good grind.

However, I will say that enjoying this game requires resetting some expectations - although it's structurally very similar to a lot of roguelikes out there, it has a very different ""feel."" Most importantly, it's not really a build-focused game, even though it looks like it should be one. You might occasionally get a perk or relic that matches up really well with something else, but there's nowhere near the depth you would find in something like Dead Cells or Risk of Rain. It's much more about the classes, which is totally fine for me because there are so many of them and they all have nice differences in how they play. 

Secondly, it's a lot more like a side-scrolling ARPG (except for the build crafting, like I said) than a traditional Metroidvania platformer. Individual enemies have very basic attacks and patterns; it's less about engaging with any particular enemy and reacting to their actions, and more about managing larger groups and using abilities in fairly well-defined cycles. Again, I had no problem with this, but you're going to be disappointed if you want something more Dark Souls or Dead Cells (parrying, blocking, rolling, etc).

Finally, the actual ""gimmick"" of the game, the ancestor system, is really not as important as you might think. 90% of a run will be determined by the class you pick, while the genetic traits are usually pretty minor. I almost wish some of the other mechanics had been eliminated and repurposed as additional genetic traits, because right now the game feels a little light in that area - which is weird, because it's sorta the whole point of the game!

But don't let these things scare you off - it's still a really fun game that has a ton of polish and a ton of content. Just go in on the game's terms instead of assuming it'll be like games that *look* the same and I think you'll enjoy it.",2022-06-09 00:42:39,2022-06-09 00:42:39,True,1,0,0.5090909004211425,0,True,False,False,76561197979563122,589,71,2329,504,1769,1655778354,1253920,382,"{'Overall,': 1, ""I'm"": 1, 'really': 5, 'enjoying': 2, 'this': 2, 'game.': 1, 'I': 6, 'would': 2, 'give': 1, 'it': 4, 'a': 16, 'solid': 1, '8/10': 1, 'and': 10, ""I'll"": 1, 'probably': 1, 'put': 1, 'another': 1, 'couple': 1, 'dozen': 1, 'hours': 1, 'into': 1, 'it.': 2, 'The': 1, 'platforming': 1, 'feels': 2, 'great,': 1, 'the': 15, 'combat': 1, 'is': 4, 'snappy,': 1, 'each': 1, 'new': 1, 'biome': 1, 'has': 3, 'nice': 2, 'hook': 1, 'to': 4, 'keep': 1, 'things': 2, 'interesting.': 1, 'And': 1, ""there's"": 2, 'definitely': 1, 'lot': 3, 'of': 11, 'content': 1, 'if': 2, ""you're"": 2, 'looking': 1, 'for': 3, 'good': 1, 'grind.': 1, 'However,': 1, 'will': 2, 'say': 1, 'that': 5, 'game': 3, 'requires': 1, 'resetting': 1, 'some': 2, 'expectations': 1, '-': 3, 'although': 1, ""it's"": 6, 'structurally': 1, 'very': 3, 'similar': 1, 'roguelikes': 1, 'out': 1, 'there,': 1, 'different': 1, '""feel.""': 1, 'Most': 1, 'importantly,': 1, 'not': 2, 'build-focused': 1, 'game,': 2, 'even': 1, 'though': 1, 'looks': 1, 'like': 5, 'should': 1, 'be': 4, 'one.': 1, 'You': 1, 'might': 2, 'occasionally': 1, 'get': 1, 'perk': 1, 'or': 3, 'relic': 1, 'matches': 1, 'up': 1, 'well': 1, 'with': 3, 'something': 3, 'else,': 1, 'but': 2, 'nowhere': 1, 'near': 1, 'depth': 1, 'you': 5, 'find': 1, 'in': 5, 'Dead': 2, 'Cells': 2, 'Risk': 1, 'Rain.': 1, ""It's"": 1, 'much': 1, 'more': 4, 'about': 3, 'classes,': 1, 'which': 2, 'totally': 1, 'fine': 1, 'me': 1, 'because': 3, 'there': 1, 'are': 2, 'so': 1, 'many': 1, 'them': 1, 'they': 2, 'all': 1, 'have': 2, 'differences': 1, 'how': 1, 'play.': 1, 'Secondly,': 1, 'side-scrolling': 1, 'ARPG': 1, '(except': 1, 'build': 1, 'crafting,': 1, 'said)': 1, 'than': 1, 'traditional': 1, 'Metroidvania': 1, 'platformer.': 1, 'Individual': 1, 'enemies': 1, 'basic': 1, 'attacks': 1, 'patterns;': 1, 'less': 1, 'engaging': 1, 'any': 1, 'particular': 1, 'enemy': 1, 'reacting': 1, 'their': 1, 'actions,': 1, 'managing': 1, 'larger': 1, 'groups': 1, 'using': 1, 'abilities': 1, 'fairly': 1, 'well-defined': 1, 'cycles.': 1, 'Again,': 1, 'had': 2, 'no': 1, 'problem': 1, 'this,': 1, 'going': 1, 'disappointed': 1, 'want': 1, 'Dark': 1, 'Souls': 1, '(parrying,': 1, 'blocking,': 1, 'rolling,': 1, 'etc).': 1, 'Finally,': 1, 'actual': 1, '""gimmick""': 1, 'ancestor': 1, 'system,': 1, 'as': 3, 'important': 1, 'think.': 1, '90%': 1, 'run': 1, 'determined': 1, 'by': 1, 'class': 1, 'pick,': 1, 'while': 1, 'genetic': 2, 'traits': 1, 'usually': 1, 'pretty': 1, 'minor.': 1, 'almost': 1, 'wish': 1, 'other': 1, 'mechanics': 1, 'been': 1, 'eliminated': 1, 'repurposed': 1, 'additional': 1, 'traits,': 1, 'right': 1, 'now': 1, 'little': 1, 'light': 1, 'area': 1, 'weird,': 1, 'sorta': 1, 'whole': 1, 'point': 1, 'game!': 1, 'But': 1, ""don't"": 1, 'let': 1, 'these': 1, 'scare': 1, 'off': 1, 'still': 1, 'fun': 1, 'ton': 2, 'polish': 1, 'content.': 1, 'Just': 1, 'go': 1, 'on': 1, ""game's"": 1, 'terms': 1, 'instead': 1, 'assuming': 1, ""it'll"": 1, 'games': 1, '*look*': 1, 'same': 1, 'think': 1, ""you'll"": 1, 'enjoy': 1}"

344,115939822,english,"If I could, I'd give this a neutral recommendation. It has a really neat premise and is pretty interesting. The extra prologue afterwards is especially nice in rounding things up

Sadly, I thought this was just a bit too brief to really have a lasting impact (and I do personally enjoy very short games a lot) and the writing could do with a lot of touch ups - there's a few missing commas and everything feels a bit amateurish, especially the text for news articles

My main issue though, to put it bluntly, is that I was not very good at this. The gist is, for each person, you're given a brief description of their problems and a handful of memories. You have to delete one to try and shift their future. I was getting almost all of them wrong and didn't really know what the game wanted from me in most cases. It's not very obvious what your choices will do and from what I can tell, there's only one save file, so you have to restart if you want to try different choices

This didn't completely sour the experience though, it's still a solid narrative! I just wish it had a bit more polish to it

Basically, it's not bad but you won't miss out on much by skipping this one.
